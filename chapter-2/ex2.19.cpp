// A pointer is an object, unlike a reference. A pointer holds an address to which it
// "pointers". So it references a place in memory. The programmer can change the value held
// at that address, and it can change the address it points to. A reference is just another
// name for a variable that already exists. It is not an object, so it can't reference any
// other variable after it has been defined.
